# ReceiptToDo
a receipt-styled todo list website with html/css/js, typical beginner project that i did not want to do until i got the idea for the design. yes, i'm a sucker for aesthetics :).
i learned a lot about DOM Manipulation, and tried to minimize GPT help and use stack-overflow/geeksforgeeks...etc instead.
